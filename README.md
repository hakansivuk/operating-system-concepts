# Operating System Concepts

This repository is a container for the projects I developed during CS342 Operating System Concepts. Following projects and their detailed explanations can be found below in the order of development timeline. I collaborated with my dear colleague [Cevat](https://github.com/cevataykans "Cevat's Github") for these projects.

* [Multiprocessing vs Multithreading](https://github.com/hakansivuk/operating-system-concepts/blob/main/multiprocessing-vs-multithreading): A C project to compare performances of multiprocessing and multithreading. It was very beneficial for me to understand key differences between the two types of concurrency.
* [CPU Schedular Simulation](https://github.com/hakansivuk/operating-system-concepts/blob/main/cpu-schedular-simulation): This was a very fun project to develop. This is about simulating a CPU that schedules jobs of different processes. This project allowed me to practice deadlock presentation, synchronization and the theory of CPU scheduling.
* [Main Memory Simulation](https://github.com/hakansivuk/operating-system-concepts/blob/main/main-memory-simulator): This project is a main memory management library that allows processes to dynamically allocate/deallocate memory in a thread-safe manner.
* [Secondary Memory Simulation](https://github.com/hakansivuk/operating-system-concepts/blob/main/secondary-memory-simulation): This project is a secondary memory management library that allows processes to store data in a virtual disk containing a virtual file system using FAT.
